# Poroelasticity

The theory of poroelasticity is nowdays a widely accepted framework to study interactions between fluid flow and solids deformation in porous media. On the basis of Terzaghi's work in 1923 where the deformation of the porous media was primarily cause by reageremnts of the porous voids, Biot (1941) generalized the theory of consolidations of porous media to three dimensions where not only the compressibility of the media is introduced but also the compressibility of the filling fluid.
